            "The CPU, which stands for Central Processing Unit, is like the brain of a computer. It works really fast, just like how our brains think quickly! The CPU helps the computer do all kinds of important tasks, like solving math problems, playing games, and showing pictures on the screen. Without the CPU, computers wouldn't be able to do much at all!",
            "A keyboard is like a magical board full of buttons that we use to talk to our computers! Just like how we use our fingers to type on it, the keyboard helps us write letters, numbers, and even funny faces called emojis. It's like a special tool that helps us tell our computer what to do, whether it's writing stories, playing games, or exploring the internet. With a keyboard, we can make our computer understand all the amazing things we want to tell it!",
            "Imagine having a little helper that helps you move things around on your computer screen just by moving it around on your desk! That's what a mouse does! A mouse is a small, handy tool that you can hold in your hand. It has buttons you can click, and when you move it on a special pad, it moves a little arrow on your computer screen, just like magic! With a mouse, you can click on icons, play games, draw pictures, and explore all sorts of amazing things on your computer!",
